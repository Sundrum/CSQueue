# CSQueue
Making a queue implementation using C# arrays and dependency injection. 
This was a task presented by UiS to get us into the basics of C#. 
The program contains a console with inputs and outputs. There are only four available commands, which are:
* add - Triggers the Enqueue() command and adds the following statement to the queue
* rem - Triggers the Dequeue() command which removes the first element from the queue and returns it to the user
* size - Triggers the Length command which gives the number of elements in the queue
* exit - closes the program.

It also contains an Enumerator which prints the whole queue, but there is no command for it in the terminal.
